## Milestone 3: (Week 4, 30 points)

Merge the earlier branch into the main branch and create a new branch titled ‘milestone-3. Do not delete the milestone-2 branch.

Repeat the analysis in Milestone 2 but this time use [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/kagglers-guide-to-lightgbm-hyperparameter-tuning-with-optuna-in-2021-ed048d9838b5) or [this](https://neptune.ai/blog/lightgbm-parameters-guide) guide to tune with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model.

You need to creating a streamlit app for the house price prediction problem. Streamlit is a python library that allows you to create web apps with minimal coding and deploy them in the cloud. Deploy the streamlit app in [HuggingFace streamlit spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-streamlit) after you create a free account. The app must resemble [this UI](https://adhok-streamlit-ames-housing-price-predict-streamlit-app-lp8hyj.streamlit.app/) (please avoid the shown gif image) and in addition it must show a SHAP summary plot and a SHAP interaction plot.

Submit the github repository URL with a branch titled ‘milestone-3’ with the [README.md]() file containing the link to the deployed HF space where the Milestone 2 calculation and the optimized app calculation price prediction can both be seen.
