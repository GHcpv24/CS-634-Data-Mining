# Demo

(Note: You may need be required to unmute the video...)

The below demo features a HuggingFace streamlit app that references the code provided in [this repo](https://github.com/adhok/streamlit_ames_housing_price_prediction_app) by Pradeep Adhokshaja.

# Introduction

The aim of Milestone 4 is to finalize the project by focusing on documentation, creating a landing page on Google Sites for the HuggingFace streamlit app, and producing a demo video of the app. The documentation extensively covers the code, prediction outcomes, and app functionalities to provide detailed insights into the project. The landing page provides links to the project and acts as a central hub for summarizing the project's deliverables. The demo video will showcase the app's use and expected results. These three tasks performed together ensure a comprehensive, engaging, and visually appealing presentation of the project.
