For example, the Google Play Store provides millions of apps, while YouTube provides billions of videos. More apps and videos are added every day. How can users find new and compelling content? Yes, one can use search to access content. However, a recommendation engine can display items that users might not have thought to search for on their own.\n","\n","In this assignment you will use the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest) called `ml-latest`. You are free to experiment and develop your code with the `ml-latest-small` dataset but you need to **submit** your work with the `ml-latest` dataset which is much larger and will lead to better results. The `ml-latest` dataset consists of several files:\n","\n","* `genome-scores.csv`: a relevance score that a particular movie has a particular tag. Tags are things like \"action\", \"romance\", \"violence\", etc. The relevance score ranges from 0 to 1.

In other words, matrix factorization can unravel user preferences and item characteristics, enabling personalized recommendations. Another strong point of matrix factorization is good scalability to handle massive datasets.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Challenges that Matrix Factorization Faces\n","However, matrix factorization encounters challenges. When dealing with new users and/or items that lack sufficient historical data, matrix factorization faces a \"cold start\" problem due to its inability to address the new information. Effective approaches must be devised to provide recommendations without extensive user/item information.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Prediction\n","Let's move on to talk about the equations that drive matrix factorization's predictive capabilities by going over its prediction equation. Let each item $i$ be associated with vector $q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and each user $u$ be associated with a vector $p_u \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The dot product $q_i^Tp_u$ captures the relationship between the user and the object (i.e. the user's general interest in the item). Let $r_{ui}$ denote user's rating of item, which is then estimated by:\n","\n","$\\hat{r}_{ui} = q_i^Tp_u$\n","\n","Now in the case of the popular Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, as popularized by Simon Funk during the Netflix Prize competition, the prediction equation is as follows:\n","\n","$\\hat{r}_{ui} = \\mu + b_i + b_u + q_i^Tp_u$ where $\\mu$ represents the overall average rating, $b_i$ the bias term of $i$, and $b_u$ the bias term of $u$.\n","\n","The SVD prediction equation estimates the rating based on user biases, item biases, and latent factor vectors - allowing for prediction of ratings for user-item pairs not explicitly rated previously.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Optimization\n","We move onto the optimization of the algorithm that minimizes the difference between the predicted $\\hat{r}_{ui}$ and ground truth $r_{ui}$. The minimization incorporates a regularized squared error for estimating all unknown, and the unbiased equation is as follows:\n","\n","$\\min_\\limits{q^*, p^*} \\sum\\limits_{(u,i) \\in \\kappa} (r_{ui} - q_i^Tp_u)^2 + \\lambda (||q_i||^2 + ||p_u||^2)$ where $\\kappa$ is the training set - the set of ($u,i$) pairs for which $r_{ui}$ is known.\n","\n","The biased optimization equation is as follows:\n","\n","$\\min_\\limits{q^*, p^*,b^*} \\sum\\limits_{(u,i) \\in \\kappa} (r_{ui} - \\mu - b_u - b_i - q_i^Tp_u)^2 + \\lambda (||p_u||^2 + ||q_i||^2 + b_u^2 + b_i^2)$\n","\n","The model adjusts the latent factor vectors and biases to find the optimal configuration that provides a good balance between prediction accuracy and model complexity.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Surprise Library - SVD API\n","\n","The Surprise library provides a convenient SVD API (surprise.prediction_algorithms.matrix_factorization.SVD) implementing the above equations for exploring matrix factorization - taking care of the underlying computations. Though implementation details may vary slightly, the principles remain the same, not to mention, one is provided methods to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate model performance.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Conclusion\n","\n","To summarize, matrix factorization offers the mathematical framework to understand user-item interactions and make recommendations. The equations involved capture the various aspects including ratings, biases, and regularization. And finally, Surprise library's SVD API simplifies implementation of matrix factorization for building recommender systems."],"metadata":{"id":"Fl7geXxxoa5X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eYtqoXCan4XX"},"source":["## Task 2: Implement the SVD based matrix facrorization algorithm (40 points)\n","\n","Implement the matrix factorization algorithm on the movielens data using the surprise API.
